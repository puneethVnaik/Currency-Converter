## 📚 Motivation  

This project was built to **enhance JavaScript skills** by working with **fetch API, async/await functions, event listeners, and DOM manipulation**. The goal was to create a **practical and user-friendly currency converter** that provides **instant results** while handling errors gracefully.

## 🚀 How It Works  

🔹 **Currency Selection**  
- Users select the **"From"** and **"To"** currencies using dropdowns.  
- Country flags update dynamically based on the selected currency.  

🔹 **Amount Input & Conversion**  
- Users enter the amount to be converted.  
- The system **fetches live exchange rates** and calculates the converted amount.  
- The result is displayed instantly.  

🔹 **API Integration**  
- The exchange rates are retrieved from the **Open Exchange Rate API** (`open.er-api.com`).  

🔹 **Automatic & Manual Updates**  
- The conversion happens automatically on **page load** and **button click**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **HTML** – Provides the structure and layout of the interface.  
- **CSS** – Styles the UI for a smooth and clean look.  
- **JavaScript** – Implements API calls, DOM updates, and conversion logic.

## 💡 What I Learned  

🔹 Fetching real-time data using the **Fetch API** with **async/await**.  
🔹 Handling **asynchronous operations** and displaying results dynamically.  
🔹 Implementing **event listeners** for user interaction.  
🔹 Updating the **DOM dynamically** based on user input.  
🔹 Managing **API error handling** for a smoother user experience.
